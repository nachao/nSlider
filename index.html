                Google Maps JavaScript API V3 Reference

                Release Version

                Last updated Tuesday, August 04, 2015

                This reference documents version 3.21 (the release version) of the Maps Javascript API released Aug 04, 2015. This release version of the API is a feature-stable version of the API whose interfaces are guaranteed to remain as documented within these pages until this version is retired.

                To consult the latest (experimental) version of the Maps Javascript API, see the Experimental Development Reference.
                Map class

                google.maps.Map class

                This class extends MVCObject.

                Constructor
                Map(mapDiv:Node, opts?:MapOptions)  Creates a new map inside of the given HTML container, which is typically a DIV element.
                Methods
                fitBounds(bounds:LatLngBounds)  
                Return Value:  None
                Sets the viewport to contain the given bounds.
                getBounds() 
                Return Value:  LatLngBounds
                Returns the lat/lng bounds of the current viewport. If more than one copy of the world is visible, the bounds range in longitude from -180 to 180 degrees inclusive. If the map is not yet initialized (i.e. the mapType is still null), or center and zoom have not been set then the result is null or undefined.
                getCenter() 
                Return Value:  LatLng
                Returns the position displayed at the center of the map. Note that this LatLng object is not wrapped. See LatLng for more information.
                getDiv()    
                Return Value:  Node
                getHeading()    
                Return Value:  number
                Returns the compass heading of aerial imagery. The heading value is measured in degrees (clockwise) from cardinal direction North.
                getMapTypeId()  
                Return Value:  MapTypeId|string
                getProjection() 
                Return Value:  Projection
                Returns the current Projection. If the map is not yet initialized (i.e. the mapType is still null) then the result is null. Listen to projection_changed and check its value to ensure it is not null.
                getStreetView() 
                Return Value:  StreetViewPanorama
                Returns the default StreetViewPanorama bound to the map, which may be a default panorama embedded within the map, or the panorama set using setStreetView(). Changes to the map's streetViewControl will be reflected in the display of such a bound panorama.
                getTilt()   
                Return Value:  number
                Returns the current angle of incidence of the map, in degrees from the viewport plane to the map plane. The result will be 0 for imagery taken directly overhead or 45 for 45° imagery. 45° imagery is only available for SATELLITE and HYBRID map types, within some locations, and at some zoom levels. Note: This method does not return the value set by setTilt. See setTilt for details.
                getZoom()   
                Return Value:  number
                panBy(x:number, y:number)   
                Return Value:  None
                Changes the center of the map by the given distance in pixels. If the distance is less than both the width and height of the map, the transition will be smoothly animated. Note that the map coordinate system increases from west to east (for x values) and north to south (for y values).
                panTo(latLng:LatLng|LatLngLiteral)  
                Return Value:  None
                Changes the center of the map to the given LatLng. If the change is less than both the width and height of the map, the transition will be smoothly animated.
                panToBounds(latLngBounds:LatLngBounds)  
                Return Value:  None
                Pans the map by the minimum amount necessary to contain the given LatLngBounds. It makes no guarantee where on the map the bounds will be, except that as much of the bounds as possible will be visible. The bounds will be positioned inside the area bounded by the map type and navigation (pan, zoom, and Street View) controls, if they are present on the map. If the bounds is larger than the map, the map will be shifted to include the northwest corner of the bounds. If the change in the map's position is less than both the width and height of the map, the transition will be smoothly animated.
                setCenter(latlng:LatLng|LatLngLiteral)  
                Return Value:  None
                setHeading(heading:number)  
                Return Value:  None
                Sets the compass heading for aerial imagery measured in degrees from cardinal direction North.
                setMapTypeId(mapTypeId:MapTypeId|string)    
                Return Value:  None
                setOptions(options:MapOptions)  
                Return Value:  None
                setStreetView(panorama:StreetViewPanorama)  
                Return Value:  None
                Binds a StreetViewPanorama to the map. This panorama overrides the default StreetViewPanorama, allowing the map to bind to an external panorama outside of the map. Setting the panorama to null binds the default embedded panorama back to the map.
                setTilt(tilt:number)    
                Return Value:  None
                Controls the automatic switching behavior for the angle of incidence of the map. The only allowed values are 0 and 45. setTilt(0) causes the map to always use a 0° overhead view regardless of the zoom level and viewport. setTilt(45) causes the tilt angle to automatically switch to 45 whenever 45° imagery is available for the current zoom level and viewport, and switch back to 0 whenever 45° imagery is not available (this is the default behavior). 45° imagery is only available for SATELLITE and HYBRID map types, within some locations, and at some zoom levels. Note: getTilt returns the current tilt angle, not the value set by setTilt. Because getTilt and setTilt refer to different things, do not bind() the tilt property; doing so may yield unpredictable effects.

                A layer for displaying geospatial data. Points, line-strings and polygons can be displayed.

                Every Map has a Data object by default, so most of the time there is no need to construct one. For example:

                 var myMap = new google.maps.Map(...);
                 myMap.data.addGeoJson(...);
                 myMap.data.setStyle(...); 
                The Data object is a collection of Features.
                This class extends MVCObject.

                Constructor
                Data(options?:Data.DataOptions) Creates an empty collection, with the given DataOptions.
                Methods
                add(feature:Data.Feature|Data.FeatureOptions)   
                Return Value:  Data.Feature
                Adds a feature to the collection, and returns the added feature.
                If the feature has an ID, it will replace any existing feature in the collection with the same ID. If no feature is given, a new feature will be created with null geometry and no properties. If FeatureOptions are given, a new feature will be created with the specified properties.

                Note that the IDs 1234 and '1234' are equivalent. Adding a feature with ID 1234 will replace a feature with ID '1234', and vice versa.

                addGeoJson(geoJson:Object, options?:Data.GeoJsonOptions)    
                Return Value:  Array&lt;Data.Feature>
                Adds GeoJSON features to the collection. Give this method a parsed JSON. The imported features are returned. Throws an exception if the GeoJSON could not be imported.
                contains(feature:Data.Feature)  
                Return Value:  boolean
                Checks whether the given feature is in the collection.
                forEach(callback:function(Data.Feature))    
                Return Value:  None
                Repeatedly invokes the given function, passing a feature in the collection to the function on each invocation. The order of iteration through the features is undefined.
                getControlPosition()    
                Return Value:  ControlPosition
                Returns the position of the drawing controls on the map.
                getControls()   
                Return Value:  Array&lt;string>
                Returns which drawing modes are available for the user to select, in the order they are displayed. This does not include the null drawing mode, which is added by default. Possible drawing modes are "Point", "LineString" or "Polygon".
                getDrawingMode()    
                Return Value:  string
                Returns the current drawing mode of the given Data layer. A drawing mode of null means that the user can interact with the map as normal, and clicks do not draw anything. Possible drawing modes are null, "Point", "LineString" or "Polygon".
                getFeatureById(id:number|string)    
                Return Value:  Data.Feature|undefined
                Returns the feature with the given ID, if it exists in the collection. Otherwise returns undefined.
                Note that the IDs 1234 and '1234' are equivalent. Either can be used to look up the same feature.

                getMap()    
                Return Value:  Map
                Returns the map on which the features are displayed.
                getStyle()  
                Return Value:  Data.StylingFunction|Data.StyleOptions
                Gets the style for all features in the collection.
                loadGeoJson(url:string, options?:Data.GeoJsonOptions, callback?:function(Array&lt;Data.Feature>))  
                Return Value:  None
                Loads GeoJSON from a URL, and adds the features to the collection.
                overrideStyle(feature:Data.Feature, style:Data.StyleOptions)    
                Return Value:  None
                Changes the style of a feature. These changes are applied on top of the style specified by setStyle(). Style properties set to null revert to the value specified via setStyle().
                remove(feature:Data.Feature)    
                Return Value:  None
                Removes a feature from the collection.
                revertStyle(feature?:Data.Feature)  
                Return Value:  None
                Removes the effect of previous overrideStyle() calls. The style of the given feature reverts to the style specified by setStyle().
                If no feature is given, all features have their style reverted.

                setControlPosition(controlPosition:ControlPosition) 
                Return Value:  None
                Sets the position of the drawing controls on the map.
                setControls(controls:Array&lt;string>) 
                Return Value:  None
                Sets which drawing modes are available for the user to select, in the order they are displayed. This should not include the null drawing mode, which is added by default. If null, drawing controls are disabled and not displayed. Possible drawing modes are "Point", "LineString" or "Polygon".
                setDrawingMode(drawingMode:string)  
                Return Value:  None
                Sets the current drawing mode of the given Data layer. A drawing mode of null means that the user can interact with the map as normal, and clicks do not draw anything. Possible drawing modes are null, "Point", "LineString" or "Polygon".
                setMap(map:Map) 
                Return Value:  None
                Renders the features on the specified map. If map is set to null, the features will be removed from the map.
                setStyle(style:Data.StylingFunction|Data.StyleOptions)  
                Return Value:  None
                Sets the style for all features in the collection. Styles specified on a per-feature basis via overrideStyle() continue to apply.
                Pass either an object with the desired style options, or a function that computes the style for each feature. The function will be called every time a feature's properties are updated.

                toGeoJson(callback:function(Object))    
                Return Value:  None
                Exports the features in the collection to a GeoJSON object.
